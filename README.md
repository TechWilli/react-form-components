# React Form Components

In this project I created some form inputs using React to practice concepts as event handlers, form rules, among other things.

Here is some of the components you will find here:

- Text input
- TextArea
- Select input
- Radio input
- Checkbox

All the instructions was taken from [Origamid's React Completo Course](https://www.origamid.com/curso/react-completo).
